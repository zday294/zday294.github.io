        <h2>Freshman from Monroe, North Carolina</h2>

         <p>
             I am a freshman at <a href ="https://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a> studying computer science. I graduated from <a href="https://www.ucps.k12.nc.us/Domain/30">Piedmont High School</a> but spent most of my highschool career in private school.
         </p>
         <p>
            In the past I have been active in my schools' music programs including marching and concert bands, choirs, and handbell choirs. At Bob Jones, I sing in the University Singers and plan to continue my musical involvement alongside my core education. I am a member of the XED Wolves society on campus, which sponsors and participates in various outreach activities.
         </p>
         <p>
             In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube, reading, and playing Dungeons & Dragons.
